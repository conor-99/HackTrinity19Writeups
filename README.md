# Hack Trinity '19 Writeups

I had a lot of fun participating in the [Hack Trinity '19 CTF](https://hacktrinity.me/) competition this month. It was  my first time every trying anything like this so I wasn't at all prepared and I had to learn a lot of new skills on-the-fly. Nonetheless, I was fairly pleased with my result and I'll definitely be competing again next here!
